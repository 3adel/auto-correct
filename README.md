# auto-correct using transformers
This is a prototype to validate whether auto-correction is feasible using an on-device transformer-based text2text model that has been trained on synthetically generated spelling mistakes finetuning dataset. We're looking mainly at 

1. High-quality spelling mistakes correction.
2. Stellar on-device inference speed (sub 100 ms)
