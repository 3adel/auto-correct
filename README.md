# typo correction using transformers
This is an experiment to validate if typo correction is feasible using an on-device transformer-based text2text model that has been trained on a synthetically generated typos finetuning dataset. We're looking mainly at 

1. High-quality spelling mistakes correction.
2. Stellar on-device inference speed (sub 100 ms)
